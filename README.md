The consumption of contaminated water is a 
major health risk that affects individuals and organizations 
worldwide. This research paper aims to raise awareness of the 
importance of regular water testing among individuals and 
organizations by creating a web platform that provides access 
to educational materials and testing resources. A survey was 
conducted to assess the current level of awareness of water 
quality testing and identify knowledge gaps and 
misconceptions that need to be addressed. The results showed 
that many individuals and organizations have limited 
knowledge about the various contaminants found in water 
and the health risks of consuming contaminated water. The 
web platform was developed to address these knowledge gaps 
by providing information on the different types of tests that 
can be performed, how often they should be performed, and 
how the results should be interpreted. The platform also 
enables individuals and organizations to easily order water 
test kits and find local laboratories that can perform more 
extensive testing. The effectiveness of the web platform was 
evaluated by tracking user engagement and conducting 
follow-up surveys. The results showed that the web platform 
was effective in raising awareness of the importance of water 
testing and facilitating regular testing among individuals and 
organizations. These findings have important implications for 
public health and demonstrate the need for continued efforts 
to increase awareness of the importance of water quality 
testing
